# Button Styling Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
Your button styles weren't being applied because of a CSS cascade conflict in the React Button component.

## Root Cause
In both `button.tsx` and `__v2/button.ui.tsx`, the button element had this className:

```tsx
className={`btn-wrapper ${btnBaseClasses} ${className ?? ''} p-1 relative overflow-hidden`}
```

The `p-1` Tailwind utility class was overriding the design system padding because:
1. Tailwind utilities have higher CSS specificity than component classes
2. `p-1` (4px padding) was overriding the design system button padding
3. This caused buttons to appear unstyled or with minimal padding

## Solution Applied
I removed the conflicting classes from both button components:

### Before:
```tsx
className={`btn-wrapper ${btnBaseClasses} ${className ?? ''} p-1 relative overflow-hidden`}
```

### After:
```tsx
className={`${btnBaseClasses} ${className ?? ''} relative overflow-hidden`}
```

## Changes Made
1. **Removed `btn-wrapper`**: This class wasn't defined in the design system
2. **Removed `p-1`**: This was overriding the design system button padding
3. **Kept essential classes**: `relative overflow-hidden` for ripple effects

## What Should Work Now
Your buttons should now display with proper:
- ✅ Padding from design system (e.g., `--spacing-md` for medium buttons)
- ✅ Colors from design system (primary, secondary, etc.)
- ✅ Typography from design system
- ✅ Hover/focus states
- ✅ Size variants (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)

## Testing
The button in your main.tsx file:
```tsx
<Button
    id={'button-1'}
    title={'Button 1'}
    children={'Button 1'}
    onClick={function (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>): void {
        console.log('Button 1 clicked', e)
    }}
/>
```

Should now render with the default design system styling (which generates classes like `btn btn-sm btn-primary`).

## CSS Layer Order Fixed
I also fixed the CSS import order in the design system to eliminate PostCSS warnings and ensure proper cascade:

```css
/* All CSS imports first */
@import './tokens.css';
@import './primitives.css'; 
@import './components.css';
@import './utilities.css';

/* Tailwind directives after imports */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Your button styles should now be working correctly!
