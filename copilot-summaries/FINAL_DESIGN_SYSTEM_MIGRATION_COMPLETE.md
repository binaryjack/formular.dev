## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION HIGHLIGHTS

### **Core Benefits Achieved**:

1. **Consistency**: All components now use the same design tokens and styling approach
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for design decisions
3. **Performance**: Eliminated duplicate CSS and optimized class usage
4. **Developer Experience**: Consistent APIs and predictable behavior
5. **Accessibility**: Maintained all accessibility features while improving visual consistency

### **Design System Features Utilized**:

- ✅ **Color Variants**: Primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info
- ✅ **Size Scales**: 2xs, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl with consistent spacing
- ✅ **Typography System**: Complete scale with semantic HTML support
- ✅ **Component States**: Loading, disabled, error, success, focus states
- ✅ **Animation System**: Consistent transitions and micro-interactions
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints

### **Style Generation Utilities Used**:

- `generateButtonStyles()` - For button variants and states
- `generateInputStyles()` - For form input styling and states
- `generateValidationStyles()` - For form validation messaging
- `cx()` - For conditional class name management
- Design system CSS classes for switches, toggles, and typography
