## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

FORMULAR.dev.lib is a TypeScript-based form management library built on modern architectural principles including dependency injection, reactive programming, and framework-agnostic design patterns.

### 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Framework Agnostic Core**: The core library (`packages/lib`) contains no framework-specific code
2. **Dependency Injection**: IoC container system managing all services and dependencies
3. **Reactive Programming**: Observer pattern with high-performance batched notifications
4. **Prototype-Based Classes**: Performance-optimized class architecture following contributing guidelines
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions throughout the codebase

## 📦 Package Architecture

### React Adapter (`packages/vendors/react/formular.components`)

**🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT: React implementation with components and hooks**

```
packages/vendors/react/formular.components/src/
├── components/             # React form components (in development)
│   ├── formular-form/     # Main form container (needs refinement)
│   ├── input-text/        # Text input component (functional but needs polish)
│   ├── password/          # Password input with visibility toggle (basic implementation)
│   ├── date-picker/       # Date selection component (experimental)
│   └── [12+ more components] # Various input components (mixed development stages)
├── adapters/              # React-specific adapters (in progress)
│   └── react/             # React hooks and context (needs improvement)
├── core/                  # Component framework logic (under development)

### Design System (`packages/design-system`)

Design tokens and styling utilities for consistent component appearance.

```
packages/design-system/src/
├── tokens/                 # Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
├── utilities/             # Style generation utilities
├── styles/                # CSS utility classes
└── types/                 # TypeScript definitions for design system
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Design Tokens**: Typography, spacing, colors, shadows, animations
- ✅ **TailwindCSS Integration**: Utility-first CSS approach
- ✅ **Component Styling**: Style generators for form components
- ✅ **Theme Support**: Consistent theming across all packages

## 🔧 Service Architecture

### IoC Container System

The heart of FORMULAR's architecture is the dependency injection system:

```typescript
// Create service container
const serviceManager = ServiceManagerFactory.createDefault()

// Register and resolve services
const formularManager = serviceManager.getService('IFormularManager')
const notificationManager = serviceManager.getService('INotificationManager')
```

**Key Services:**
- **IFormularManager**: Form creation and management
- **INotificationManager**: Reactive event system
- **IServiceManager**: Dependency injection container
- **IValidationManager**: Validation rule processing
- **IStyleManager**: Dynamic styling management

### Factory Pattern Integration

FORMULAR uses factory patterns throughout for consistent object creation:

```typescript
// Form creation with builder pattern
const formular = new FormularManagerBuilder()
    .setId('user-form')
    .addField(emailField)
    .addValidation(Validators.required())
    .build()

// Service container creation
const serviceManager = ServiceManagerFactory.createWithConfiguration({
    environment: 'development',
    enableLogging: true
})
```

## 🧪 Testing Architecture

### Test Organization

```
packages/*/src/__tests__/
├── unit/                   # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/           # Integration tests across services
├── mocks/                 # Shared mock objects and builders
└── utilities/             # Test utilities and helpers
```

**Coverage Status:**
- **Core Library**: 85%+ test coverage
- **React Components**: Basic test coverage, needs improvement for release quality
- **Web Components**: Experimental framework with basic test coverage
- **Design System**: 90%+ test coverage

### Mock System

FORMULAR provides comprehensive mocks for testing:

```typescript
// Available from core library for consumer testing
import { 
    fileDescriptorMock, 
    validationBuilderMock,
    formularManagerMock 
} from 'formular.dev.lib'
```

## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

### Core Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Services and dependencies loaded on-demand
2. **Batched Notifications**: Event processing optimized for performance
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and circular dependency detection
4. **Prototype Classes**: Optimized class architecture avoiding transpilation overhead
5. **Tree Shaking**: Modular exports for optimal bundle sizes

### Bundle ComponentSizeType Impact

- **Core Library**: ~45KB minified (framework-agnostic)
- **React Adapter**: ~25KB additional (with components)
- **Web Components**: ~35KB minified (experimental framework)
- **Design System**: ~15KB (with TailwindCSS utilities)

## 🔗 Integration Patterns

### React Integration

```typescript
import { ServiceManagerFactory } from 'formular.dev.lib'
import { useService } from 'formular.dev.react'

// Hook-based integration (experimental API)
const { getService } = useService()
const formularManager = getService('IFormularManager')

// Note: React adapter API is still evolving and may change
```

### Web Components Integration

```typescript
import { createWebComponentManagers, FwcElement } from 'formular.dev.web-components'

// Experimental custom element with reactive properties
class MyFormInput extends FwcElement {
    static get observedAttributes() {
        return ['value', 'placeholder', 'required']
    }
    
    connectedCallback() {
        super.connectedCallback()
        // Note: This is experimental API and may change
        this.setupReactiveProperties()
    }
}
```

### Vanilla JavaScript Integration

```typescript
import { ServiceManagerFactory } from 'formular.dev.lib'

// Direct service usage
const serviceManager = ServiceManagerFactory.createDefault()
const formularManager = serviceManager.getService('IFormularManager')
```
