# DatePicker Clear Button Fix

## Issue Description

In the ValidationDemoDatePicker, when a user:

1. Fills in a valid date
2. Submits the form (field becomes valid with green border)
3. Clicks the clear button in the date picker
4. The field border remains green (valid) even though the field is now empty and should be invalid (since it's required)

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem was that there were **two separate clear operations**:

1. **Date picker header clear button** - Only cleared the visual selection (`setSelection([])`) but did not clear the actual input field value
2. **Field clear operation** - Called `instance?.input?.clear()` which properly clears the field value and triggers validation

When users clicked the clear button in the date picker header, only the visual selection was cleared, but the actual field value remained unchanged. Since the field value was still present, the validation state (`isValid`) remained true, keeping the green border.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced DatePickerContentDrawer Interface

Added an optional `onClearField` callback to the props interface:

```tsx
interface IDatePickerDrawerProps {
    // ...existing props...
    onClearField?: () => void
    // ...other props...
}
```

### 2. Updated Clear Function Logic

Modified the `clear` function in the DatePickerContext to call both operations:

```tsx
clear: () => {
    setSelection([]) // Clear visual selection
    onClearField?.() // Clear actual field value
}
```

### 3. Connected Field Clear Callback

In the DatePickerSF component, passed the field clear function to the drawer:

```tsx
<DatePickerContentDrawer
    // ...other props...
    onClearField={() => instance?.input?.clear()}
    // ...other props...
/>
```

## How the Fix Works

Now when the user clicks the clear button in the date picker header:

1. **Visual Selection Cleared**: `setSelection([])` removes any selected dates from the picker UI
2. **Field Value Cleared**: `instance?.input?.clear()` is called, which:
    - Clears the actual input field value
    - Triggers validation (due to our earlier fix in `clear.ts`)
    - Updates `isValid` property to `false` (since field is required)
    - Updates validation-related styles (border becomes red/invalid)

## Result

- ✅ Clear button now properly clears both visual selection AND field value
- ✅ Validation is triggered after clearing, updating `isValid` state correctly
- ✅ Border color changes from green (valid) to red (invalid) when required field is cleared
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- ✅ Trigger mode configuration with `'onClear'` still works as expected

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/date-picker/date-picker.drawer.content.tsx`
    - Added `onClearField?: () => void` to props interface
    - Updated clear function to call both selection clear and field clear
2. `src/components/date-picker/date-picker.sf.tsx`
    - Added `onClearField={() => instance?.input?.clear()}` to DatePickerContentDrawer props

This fix ensures that clearing a date picker field properly updates both the visual state and the validation state, providing the correct user feedback.
