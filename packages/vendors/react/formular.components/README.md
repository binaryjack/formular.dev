# FORMULAR React Components

This package serves two purposes and depends on shared assets for logo icons and other shared resources.

## ðŸ“¦ Library (for consumption by other projects)

- **`src/index.ts`** - Main library exports for React components and adapters
- **`src/adapters/`** - React-specific adapters and utilities
- **`src/components/`** - Reusable React components

## ðŸ”§ Demo/Development App (for development and testing)

- **`src/main.tsx`** - Entry point for the development application
- **`src/index.tsx`** - Demo-specific exports and utilities
- **`src/app.tsx`** - Main demo application component
- **`index.html`** - HTML entry point (references `main.tsx`)

| `src/index.ts`  | Library exports | When this package is imported as a dependency |
| `src/main.tsx`  | Demo app entry  | When running `pnpm dev` for development       |
| `src/index.tsx` | Demo exports    | For development utilities and demo components |
