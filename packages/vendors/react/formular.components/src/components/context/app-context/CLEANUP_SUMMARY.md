# AppContext Cleanup Summary

## What was done:

### Analysis Results:

- Found two implementations of AppContext:
    1. **Original**: `app-context.context.tsx` + `app-context.tsx` (actively used)
    2. **Enhanced**: `app-context-enhanced.context.tsx` + `app-context-enhanced.tsx` (experimental/migration files)

### Key Findings:

- The **original implementation** was the complete and actively used version
- The **enhanced version** was functionally identical but used by only 3 files:
    - `index-enhanced.tsx` (alternative entry point)
    - `.storybook/preview.ts`
    - `use-service-enhanced.ts`
- Main application (`index.tsx`) and all components were using the original implementation

### Actions Taken:

1. ✅ **Merged useful features**: Added `appContextDefault` export from enhanced version to main implementation
2. ✅ **Updated references**: Changed storybook and other files to use main implementation
3. ✅ **Removed duplicate files**:
    - `app-context-enhanced.context.tsx`
    - `app-context-enhanced.tsx`
    - `index-enhanced.tsx`
    - `use-service-enhanced.ts`
    - `MERGE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
    - `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

### Final State:

- ✅ Single, consolidated AppContext implementation
- ✅ No broken imports or references
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Cleaner codebase without duplication

The main AppContext implementation in `app-context.context.tsx` and `app-context.tsx` is now the single source of truth.
