// Types moved to core/framework/types/ for better organization:
// - ElementPositionOutputType moved to core/framework/types/element-position-output.type
// - OrientationTypesType moved to core/framework/types/orientation-types.type  
// - ValueOf moved to core/framework/types/value-of.type
// - ScreenOrientationType moved to core/framework/utility/screen-orientation/screen-orientation.type

// All types have been moved to framework - this file kept for backwards compatibility
// but no longer exports anything to avoid conflicts
