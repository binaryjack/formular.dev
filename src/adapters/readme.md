## Community-Contributed Adapters

This section is for community contributors to share their expertise by creating adapters for any JavaScript-based technologies. Adapters help integrate various frameworks, libraries, or tools with the core system, enabling seamless interoperability.

### Example Adapters

- **React Adapter:** Integrate with React components and lifecycle.
- **Vue Adapter:** Enable compatibility with Vue.js applications.
- **Angular Adapter:** Bridge Angular services and components.
- **Svelte Adapter:** Connect Svelte stores and components.

> **Note:**  
> Contributors are encouraged to follow best practices and ensure adapters are well-documented and tested for their respective technologies.
