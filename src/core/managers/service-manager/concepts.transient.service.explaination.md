Transient Lifetime Definition
Transient means "short-lived" or "temporary." In dependency injection, a transient service is designed to:

Create a new instance every time it's requested
Never cache or reuse instances
Have no shared state between different consumers
Why No Caching for Transient Services?

1. Fresh Instance Every Time
2. Isolation and Independence
   Each consumer gets their own independent instance
   No shared state between different parts of your application
   Prevents unwanted side effects from state mutations
3. Stateless Services
   Transient services are typically used for:

- Stateless operations (calculators, validators, formatters)
- Short-lived operations (HTTP requests, file operations)
- Services that shouldn't maintain state between calls

Real-World Example

```
// Transient - Good for stateless operations
container.register('calculator', () => new Calculator(), { lifetime: 'transient' })

// Singleton - Good for shared state/resources
container.register('database', () => new DatabaseConnection(), { lifetime: 'singleton' })

// Scoped - Good for request-level state
container.register('userContext', () => new UserContext(), { lifetime: 'scoped' })
```

Memory and Performance Implications
Transient: More memory allocation but complete isolation
Singleton: Less memory but shared state risks
Scoped: Balanced approach for request-scoped scenarios
The "no caching" for transient services is intentional and ensures that each resolution gives you a completely fresh, independent instance! ðŸŽ¯
